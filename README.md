## Installation

Choose **one** of the following methods: **pip** or **uv**.

### pip

> We recommend using a fresh virtual environment (e.g., `conda`, `venv`, etc.) to avoid conflicts.

**Step 1**: Install PyTorch

<details>
<summary>NVIDIA GPU</summary>

```bash
# Install pytorch with your CUDA version, e.g.
pip install torch==2.8.0+cu128 torchaudio==2.8.0+cu128 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```
> See [PyTorch official site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for other versions installation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Apple Silicon</summary>

```bash
pip install torch==2.8.0 torchaudio==2.8.0
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Intel Arc GPU (XPU)</summary>

Intel Arc GPUs (Alchemist and Battlemage architectures) are supported via PyTorch's XPU backend.

1. Install the [Intel GPU drivers](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/installation.html) for your OS.

2. Install PyTorch with XPU support from Intel's wheel index:

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/release-whl/stable/xpu/us/
```

> See [Intel's PyTorch XPU guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/xpu/latest/) for version-specific instructions.

3. Verify the backend is working:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.xpu.is_available(), torch.xpu.device_count())"
```

**Notes**:
- `flash_attn` is not available on XPU; the model automatically falls back to SDPA.
- Training with packed sequences (`flex_attention`) has partial XPU support; single-GPU SDPA training should work.
- Tested on Arc A310 (Alchemist, 4 GB) and Arc Pro B50 (Battlemage, 16 GB).

</details>

**Step 2**: Install OmniVoice (choose one)

```bash
# From PyPI (stable release)
pip install omnivoice

# From the latest source on GitHub (no need to clone)
pip install git+https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice.git

# For development (clone first, editable install)
git clone https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice.git
cd OmniVoice
pip install -e .
```

### uv

Clone the repository and sync dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice.git
cd OmniVoice
uv sync
```

> **Tip**: Can use mirror with `uv sync --default-index "https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple"`

---

## Quick Start

Try OmniVoice without coding:

- Launch the local web UI: `omnivoice-demo --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8001`

- Or try it directly on [HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/k2-fsa/OmniVoice)

- Or run it in Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/k2-fsa/OmniVoice/blob/master/docs/OmniVoice.ipynb)

> If you have trouble connecting to HuggingFace when downloading the pre-trained models, set `export HF_ENDPOINT="https://hf-mirror.com"` before running.

For full usage, see the [Python API](#python-api) and [Command-Line Tools](#command-line-tools) sections below.

---

## Python API

OmniVoice supports three generation modes. All features in this section are also available via [command-line tools](#command-line-tools).

### Voice Cloning

Clone a voice from a short reference audio. Provide `ref_audio` and `ref_text`:

```python
from omnivoice import OmniVoice
import soundfile as sf
import torch

model = OmniVoice.from_pretrained(
    "k2-fsa/OmniVoice",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.float16
)
# Apple Silicon users: use device_map="mps" instead
# Intel Arc GPU users: use device_map="xpu" instead

audio = model.generate(
    text="Hello, this is a test of zero-shot voice cloning.",
    ref_audio="ref.wav",
    ref_text="Transcription of the reference audio.",
) # audio is a list of `np.ndarray` with shape (T,) at 24 kHz.

# If you don't want to input `ref_text` manually, you can directly omit the `ref_text`.
# The model will use Whisper ASR to auto-transcribe it. To use a local copy (or
# a different Whisper model), pass `asr_model_name="..."` to `from_pretrained`.
# To control which device Whisper is loaded on (e.g. another GPU in multi-GPU
# setups, or the CPU), pass `asr_device="cuda:1"` (or `"cpu"`).

sf.write("out.wav", audio[0], 24000)
```

#### Reusing a cloned voice across sessions

Encode the reference audio once, save the resulting prompt, and skip the
audio loading / auto-transcription steps in later sessions:

```python
prompt = model.create_voice_clone_prompt(
    ref_audio="ref.wav", ref_text="Transcription of the reference audio."
)
prompt.save("my_voice.pt")

# Later, in a new session:
from omnivoice import VoiceClonePrompt

prompt = VoiceClonePrompt.load("my_voice.pt")
audio = model.generate(text="Hello again!", voice_clone_prompt=prompt)
```

> **Tips**
>
> - Use a 3–10 seconds reference audio clip. Longer audio slows down inference and may degrade cloning quality.
> - For standard pronunciation, use a reference audio in the **same language** as the target speech. In cross-lingual voice cloning (i.e., the reference audio and target speech are in different languages), the generated speech will carry an accent from the reference audio's language.
> - For better results with Arabic numerals, normalize them to words first (e.g., "123" → "one hundred twenty-three"). You can pass `normalize_text=True` to `generate()` to do this automatically (opt-in; install the extra with `pip install "omnivoice[tn]"`, which pulls in [WeTextProcessing](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/WeTextProcessing)):
>
>   ```python
>   # "I have 2345 apples." is read correctly instead of digit-by-digit.
>   audio = model.generate(text="I have 2345 apples.", normalize_text=True)
>   ```
>
>   Chinese and English use WeTextProcessing; other languages fall back to `num2words` for integers. Inline control syntax (`[laughter]`, `[B EY1 S]`, pinyin tone markers) is preserved. On macOS (Apple Silicon), `pynini` has no wheel — install it via `conda install -c conda-forge pynini` first.
>
> For more tips, see [docs/tips.md](docs/tips.md).

### Voice Design

Describe the desired voice with speaker attributes — no reference audio needed.
Supported attributes: **gender** (male/female), **age** (child to elderly),
**pitch** (very low to very high), **style** (whisper), **English accent**
(American, British, etc.), and **Chinese dialect** (四川话, 陕西话, etc.).
Attributes are comma-separated and freely combinable across categories.

```python
audio = model.generate(
    text="Hello, this is a test of zero-shot voice design.",
    instruct="female, low pitch, british accent",
)
```

> **Note**: The model is primarily trained on the voice cloning task, so voice cloning is the most stable mode. Voice design is trained on Chinese and English data only. It can generalize to other languages, but may produce unstable results for some low-resource languages or edge cases.

See [docs/voice-design.md](docs/voice-design.md) for the full attribute
reference, Chinese equivalents, and usage tips.

### Auto Voice

Let the model choose a voice automatically:

```python
audio = model.generate(text="This is a sentence without any voice prompt.")
```

### Generation Parameters

All above three modes share the same `model.generate()` API. You can further control the generation behavior via keyword arguments:

```python
audio = model.generate(
    text="...",
    num_step=32,  # diffusion steps (or 16 for faster inference)
    speed=1.0,     # speed factor (>1.0 faster, <1.0 slower)
    duration=10.0, # fixed output duration in seconds (overrides speed)
    # ... more options
)
```
See more detailed control in [docs/generation-parameters.md](docs/generation-parameters.md).

### Non-Verbal & Pronunciation Control

OmniVoice supports inline **non-verbal symbols** and **pronunciation correction** within the input text.

**Non-verbal symbols**: Insert tags like `[laughter]` directly in the text to add expressive non-verbal sounds.

```python
audio = model.generate(text="[laughter] You really got me. I didn't see that coming at all.")
```

Supported tags: `[laughter]`, `[sigh]`, `[confirmation-en]`, `[question-en]`, `[question-ah]`, `[question-oh]`, `[question-ei]`, `[question-yi]`, `[surprise-ah]`, `[surprise-oh]`, `[surprise-wa]`, `[surprise-yo]`, `[dissatisfaction-hnn]`.

**Pronunciation control (Chinese)**: Use pinyin with tone numbers to correct specific character pronunciations.

```python
audio = model.generate(text="这批货物打ZHE2出售后他严重SHE2本了，再也经不起ZHE1腾了。")
```

**Pronunciation control (English)**: Use [CMU pronunciation dictionary](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict.0.7a)  (uppercase, in brackets) to override default English pronunciations.

```python
audio = model.generate(text="He plays the [B EY1 S] guitar while catching a [B AE1 S] fish.")
```

## Command-Line Tools

Three CLI entry points are provided. The CLI tools support all features available in the Python API (voice cloning, voice design, auto voice, generation parameters, etc.) — all controlled via command-line arguments.

| Command | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `omnivoice-demo` | Interactive Gradio web demo | [omnivoice/cli/demo.py](omnivoice/cli/demo.py) |
| `omnivoice-infer` | Single-item inference | [omnivoice/cli/infer.py](omnivoice/cli/infer.py) |
| `omnivoice-infer-batch` | Batch inference across multiple GPUs | [omnivoice/cli/infer_batch.py](omnivoice/cli/infer_batch.py) |

### Demo

```bash
omnivoice-demo --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

Provides a web UI for voice cloning and voice design. See `omnivoice-demo --help` for all options.

### Single Inference

```bash
# Voice Cloning
# ref_text can be omitted (Whisper will auto-transcribe ref_audio to get it).
omnivoice-infer \
    --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --text "This is a test for text to speech." \
    --ref_audio ref.wav \
    --ref_text "Transcription of the reference audio." \
    --output hello.wav

# Voice Design
omnivoice-infer --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --text "This is a test for text to speech." \
    --instruct "male, British accent" \
    --output hello.wav

# Auto Voice
omnivoice-infer \
    --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --text "This is a test for text to speech."\
    --output hello.wav
```

### Batch Inference

`omnivoice-infer-batch` can distribute batch inference across multiple GPUs, designed for large-scale TTS tasks.

```bash
omnivoice-infer-batch \
    --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --test_list test.jsonl \
    --res_dir results/
```

The test list is a JSONL file where each line is a JSON object:
```json
{"id": "sample_001", "text": "Hello world", "ref_audio": "/path/to/ref.wav", "ref_text": "Reference transcript", "instruct": "female, british accent", "language_id": "en", "duration": 10.0, "speed": 1.0}
```
Only `id` and `text` are mandatory fields. `ref_audio` and `ref_text` are used in voice cloning mode. `instruct` is used in voice design mode. If no reference audio or instruct are provided, the model will generate text in a random voice.

`language_id`, `duration`, and `speed` are optional. `duration` (in seconds) fixes the output length; `speed` controls the speaking rate. If `duration` and `speed` are both provided, `speed` will be ignored.

### FlashInfer Acceleration

Inference can be accelerated ~2-2.9x losslessly with [FlashInfer](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer) kernels (sequence packing for the CFG cond/uncond pair, fused RMSNorm/RoPE/GEMM kernels, and optional CUDA graphs).

**Installation** (NVIDIA GPUs; pick the index matching your CUDA version, e.g. cu128 for PyTorch built with CUDA 12.8):

```bash
pip install flashinfer-python==0.6.15.post1 "flashinfer-jit-cache==0.6.15.post1+cu128" \
    --extra-index-url https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu128/
```

**Usage** with the batch inference CLI:

```bash
omnivoice-infer-batch \
    --model k2-fsa/OmniVoice \
    --test_list test.jsonl \
    --res_dir results/ \
    --batch_size 8 \
    --enable_flashinfer true
```

or with the Python API:

```python
from omnivoice.models.omnivoice_flashinfer import apply_flashinfer

model = OmniVoice.from_pretrained("k2-fsa/OmniVoice", device_map="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
apply_flashinfer(model)                          # throughput / batched inference
apply_flashinfer(model, enable_cuda_graph=True)  # recommended for batch=1 (low latency)
```

CUDA graphs are recommended for single-stream (batch=1) usage, where kernel-launch overhead dominates; at batch >= 4 the plain FlashInfer path is already the fastest configuration.

**Benchmark** (seed-tts zh testset, 2020 samples / 3.3h audio, voice cloning, single H100, fp16, `num_step=32`; Average RTF as reported by `omnivoice-infer-batch`, outputs ASR-verified lossless):

| batch size | baseline | FlashInfer | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.0899 | 0.0430 | 2.1x |
| 1 + CUDA graph | — | 0.0367 | 2.4x |
| 2 | 0.0480 | 0.0245 | 2.0x |
| 4 | 0.0331 | 0.0152 | 2.2x |
| 8 | 0.0298 | **0.0115** | **2.6x** |
